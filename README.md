Based on nature, neural networks are the normal representation we construct of the brain: neurons interconnected to other neurons which makes a network. Basic information transits in a multitude of them before becoming a real item, like “move the hand to take up this pencil”. The functioning of a full neural network is simple: the variables are entered (e.g. an image if a neural network should tell what is in an image) and the output is provided following certain computations (after the first example, a cat picture should return the word "cat"). Now, you should know the normal column-based artificial neural network, such that only neurons from columns n-1 and n+1 may be linked to a neuron in column n-1. Some sorts of networks are using a different design, but for the time being, we will focus on the simplest.
